Cash is outdated. Online banking sucks. Crypto is a scam. We need something new

# Context

Having just moved to the UK for a little over a month, I have yet to open a traditional bank account. I have tried but there seems to be issues with verifying my identity.

> Revolut is a global neobank and financial technology company that offers banking services. Headquartered in London
It allows users to create virtual debit cards that can be used in the UK via Apple Pay.

For the past month, this has worked out perfectly. Every other day, I visit my nearest Tesco and buy the food I need. This has stayed consistent for the entire month.
I buy the same foods every week: a pack of cheese, three packs of lettuce, and six eggs. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I buy a sandwich from Lidle.

Today, on November 1st 2023, I did not buy a sandwich as I got free pizza from the university. To my surprise, I my card was declined. This is the first time that has ever happened to me.<br/>

And so, I had no food for the night. Even as I'm writing this, I'm still starving.

I have contacted support, and according to them, it might take up to 7 days until it is resolved. <br/>

# Cash

This all could have been solved if I just kept some cash. However, as someone who has never commited a crime nor criticized the British government,
I thought it would be ridiculous if I was denied my own money. This is **The West** after all where freedom is absolute.

Well, I do have cash, just in the wrong currency. It's 9PM and without British money, there was no way for me to make my way to an exchange that accepted MYR.

Once this is all resolved, I will be buying a safe and keeping everything I own as cash. This won't work with online services though, and as a software developer, I can't exactly live without online transactions (e.g. DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, etc)

# Crypto

Crypto is the closest I can think of to "digital cash". However, its value is completely speculative and the supposed "StableCoins" are backed by nothing but the promises of sketchy shell companies.
It is bad for the environment and difficult to use in real life. Most crypto are scams. I do hold some Monero due to its prevalence in certain sectors.

# A need for a government backed digital cash

[China is doing it](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chinas-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work.html), although an implementation I definitely disagree with.
Cash should be fundamentally anonymous. 
Unlike the Chinese yuan, decentralization is a necessity for such a currency to operate in the western world where freedom is valued.
There are lessons to be learnt from Monero.

However, it should also be backed. The current fiat "cash" today does not meet that requirement since the US [fell off the gold standard in 1973](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp).

## Why the government

Despite the decreasing trust in institutions, governments are here to stay. It is a guarantor of value, of the promise that the gold/oil backing the currency actually exists.
I would rather have it be the government than some shady company in Malta.
