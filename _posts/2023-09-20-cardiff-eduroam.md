Today, I moved into Talybont Court and had some issues connecting to the WIFI network.

Their instructions only support the common operating systems (Windows, iOS, Android, Ubuntu). While you might assume that the installer script for Ubuntu would work for other Linux distros, it fails due to missing dependencies and different file paths.Error messages were non-existant. It just hangs at 100% CPU.
Additionally, it's very insecure to run their script as it installs a root CA that could allow them to conduct MITM attacks.

Dependencies:
- `openssl`
- Gnome Settings

Steps:
1. Connect to `CU-Wireless`.
2. Go to https://onboard.cardiff.ac.uk/.
3. Select your operating system as "Other."
4. Enter your university email and passwordâ€”the same one used for the intranet.
5. Download all the certificates and files. Don't close the tab. Copy the certificate password.
6. Run `openssl pkcs12 -in OnboardCertificate.pkcs12` and enter the certificate password from the site three times for convenience.
7. Copy and save the certificate and private key in separate files. Place them somewhere you won't move/delete. I put them in `~/.config/certs`
8. Connect to the `eduroam` network with the following settings (Refer to the image below):

The "User key password" is the certificate password from earlier.
